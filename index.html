		<p class= paragraph>I am a hard-working, capable person who has a bright, charismatic personality. I am a team
player who works well with other persons but I am also a leader in my own right. I believe in
fairness and of giving everyone, who is deserving of it, a fair chance. I am friendly, sociable, and
easy to get along with. I also believe in doing my best no matter what. I staunchly disagree with
mediocre work. I am also honest and trustworthy. I would bring to your establishment vivacity and hard work while learning as much as I can.</p>
